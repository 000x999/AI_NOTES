# What is AI ?
- Systems that think like humans. 
- Systems that think rationally.
# Acting Humanly : The Turing test
## Can machines think ? 
- In general, this translates to $\rightarrow$ Can machines behave intelligently?
- One operational test for intelligent behavior is the "Imitation game", which is a Turing test developed in 1950. 
-  For that to happen the machine should be capable of: 
	- Natural language processing.
	- Knowledge representation.
	- Automated reasoning.
	- Machine learning.
# Thinking humanly : Cognitive Science
## Cognitive revolution: 
 -  In the 1960's came the term "cognitive revolution", this term encompasses the desire to understand how humans "think" and to imitate, simulate and replicate that into a machine. 
 - This process requires deep knowledge of all internal scientific processes of the brain. 
	 - Using what level of abstraction? Simply through knowledge? or Circuits?
	 - How does the brain process information? How would a replicated system process information without organic matter? 
- Neural Networks is one of the answers. 
# Thinking rationally : Laws of Thought
- Thinking rationally largely implies thinking in a Normal/Prescriptive way rather than in a descriptive way. 
- Aristotle posed an interesting yet thought provoking question: What are correct arguments or correct thought processes. This question triggered several Greek schools to develop various forms of logic through notation and rules of derivation for thoughts. These may or may not have lead the idea of mechanization. 
## Problems encountered: 
- Not all intelligent behavior is mediated by logical deliberation. This means that not all forms of intelligent life solve problems through logical processes. Some solve problems through sheer force, violence, avoidance etc. 
- What is the purpose of thinking? What thoughts **should** I have out of all the thoughts (logical or otherwise) that I **could** have? 
- Are the premises we have always perfect, certain, or correct? This is basically questioning the validity of our thoughts. 
# Rational agents 
- An agent is an entity that perceives and acts. This can be understood as an agent is a person, that acts un-prompted out of their own volition. They react to their environment and make logical decisions according to whatever situation they are put in. 
- More formally, Computer agents are expected to: 
	- Operate autonomously. 
	- Perceive their environment. 
	- Persist over a prolonged time period.
	- Adapt to change. 
	- Create and pursue goals. 
- A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome. 
# AI prehistory
- **Philosophy:** Logic, methods of reasoning, the mind as a physical system, foundations of learning and rationality. 
- **Mathematics:** Forma representation of proofs and algorithms. Computation, undecidability, decidability, intractability, tractability, probability. 
- **Psychology:** Adaptation, phenomena of perception and motor control, experimental techniques (psychophysics, etc.). 
- **Economy:** Formal theory of rational decisions.
- **Linguistics:** Knowledge representation, grammar. 
- **Neuroscience:** Plastic physical substrate for mental activity. 
- **Control theory:** Homeostatic systems, stability, simple optimal agent designs. 
# Potted history of AI

# Risks and benefits of AI
- Benefits: 
  - Decreasing repetitive and menial work. 
  - Increasing production of goods and services. 
  - Accelerating scientific research (Cures of diseases, Research on climate change, Solutions of resource shortages)
- Risks:
  - Lethal autonomous weapons. 
  - Surveillance and persuasion. 
  - Biased decision making. 
  - Impact on employment. 
  - Safety-critical applications. 
  - Cyber-Sec threats.
- Development of an AI that surpasses human intelligence may pose a significant risk. This is analogous to the "Gorilla problem". Humans are primates with superintelligence compared to primates and all other beings on earth, thus, we reign over all of them. This enforces the point that we should only design AI systems in a way that don't end up taking control over us in the way Turing speculated they might.
